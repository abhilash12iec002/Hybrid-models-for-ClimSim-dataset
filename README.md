# Hybrid-models-for-ClimSim-dataset
This includes two hybrid regression algorithms that couple the nature-inspired algorithms Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) and Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) with fuzzy theory. These algorithms can be applied to any regression task across various application domains, beyond just earth and environmental sciences.

Due to the large size of the data, it is not uploaded along with the code. Kindly download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leap-atmospheric-physics-ai-climsim/data
