# Hybrid-models-for-ClimSim-dataset
This includes two hybrid regression algorithms that couple the nature-inspired algorithms Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) and Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO) with fuzzy theory. These algorithms can be applied to any regression task across various application domains, beyond just earth and environmental sciences.
